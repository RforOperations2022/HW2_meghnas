Chronic Kidney Disease Dashboard

The data used for this dashboard was taken over a 2-month period in India with 25 features ( eg, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, etc). 
The data was sourced from a Chronic KIdney Disease dataset on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease). The aim of this dashboard is to understand
the charecteristics of patients with Chronic KIdney Disease (CKD). The dashboard also allows the user to analyse the affects of comorbidities such as Hypertension
and Diabetes on a CKD patient.
